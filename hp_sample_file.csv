However, one area where this strategy is lagging is in providing authentic laboratory science experiences. Our Remote Online Lab Network enables students to use real experimental devices via a web browser, thereby addressing many of the logistical limitations of ???hands-on??? labs. Because the labs are online 24/7, students can carry out their lab investigations from any location with Internet access, providing significantly more lab time with greater flexibility of access. We also support innovation and engagement by providing access to professional-caliber equipment that would never be feasible in secondary school classrooms.  Our network operates as an international collaborative of universities to share instrumentation with high schools to create a virtual distributed science lab.  An efficacy trial with nearly 1000 students in Fall 2009 demonstrated very significant pre/post learning gains in both science content and process skills.  Now that initial curriculum and labs have been brought online and tested, we will be building out a more complete web based portal and expanding our collaborators and range of available labs and curricula.",www.ilabcentral.org,Evanston,United States of America,

Actually students gain and accumulate most of their IT knowledge, skills, and practical experiences through off-class study and practices.    In collaborative learning, students learn mutually and collaboratively in helping each other and building up knowledge, skills and comprehension through communication, discussion, problem solving and projects.    We plan to apply the idea of collaborative learning to IT courses. On the supportive online learning platform, we will explore a promising online collaborative learning pattern, which would combine class lecturing with collaborative learning to tackle the foregoing challenges and improve education quality.    More courses will be involved when this way of education proves effective. The achievement and experiences from it will be shared across different institutions and instructors.

2010,Multiversity,Western Washington University,Erin,Macri,Erin.Macri@wwu.edu,Remote Access to Scientific Instrumentation and Online Labs for STEM Education: Building Laboratory Parity throughout the Curriculum,"Lack of access to scientific instrumentation represents a significant factor in the educational divide that often exists between high schools, two and four-year institutions.  Students taking equivalent science courses (AP Chemistry, Introductory College Chemistry) have significantly different laboratory experiences based on access to and use of instrumentation.  This divide places students from instrument poor feeder institutions entering instrument rich four-year science degree programs at a significant disadvantage.  The goal of this project is to use remote instrumentation and online laboratory activities to bridge the educational divide and build laboratory parity between three institutions: Western Washington University, Whatcom Community College and Squalicum High School.  Tablet PCs will be configured to allow remote access to instrumentation routinely used in undergraduate laboratories at Western.  Whatcom and Squalicum students will use the tablets to conduct real time experiments at their home institutions that are equivalent to those experienced by Western students.  This project will build on Western???s Integrated Laboratory (ILN) initiative to provide anytime/anyplace access to instrumentation to enhance learning opportunities in the sciences.

Research reports indicate that students perceive some STEM concepts as abstract and difficult. STEM teachers also perceive some concepts as difficult to teach. There is a fundamental problem for both the STEM students and teachers for any meaningful progress to be made in STEM Education.  STEM Education at the tertiary level has failed to equip learners with the skills required for survival in a modern knowledge economy. Employers complain that tertiary institutions are producing unemployable graduates. The problem with STEM Education is connected with the method of delivery where content is separated from pedagogy. The Nigerian STEM Education community is going through a vicious cycle which needs to be broken for STEM Education to be improved. This can be done at the teacher preparation level, through the provision of appropriate modern technologies that can facilitate better teaching and learning, and enhance communication and collaboration among STEM teachers, practitioners and students. Due to the low collaboration among STEM specialists and STEM Educators, there is a major gap between content knowledge and pedagogic knowledge.

We have got much more ideas about the how importance of technology issues in the instruction of middle school mathematics and also many active instructional cases. So, we are very be confident of that mathematical technology (especially, the Graph Calculator) is a very powerful medium that help students get access to powerful mathematical ideas.        Now, what confront us is how to implement these ideas in classroom instruction and that help students get access to big mathematical ideas. Based on another collaborative research project with Vanderbilt University, we notice that building learning community focusing on ambitious instructional practice for mathematics teachers is a very effective strategy to enhance students?¢Ê¢‚ mathematical learning at scales.   So, we argue that our initial idea about the use of the technology (such as Graph Calculator ) will play an important role in help student get a deep understanding of mathematics and building effective learning community focusing on the use of mathematical technology should be valued",,Beijing,China,

For example, teachers can nowadays obtain various course-related resources (e.g., e-books, texts, audios, and videos) from the Internet, and prepare for new course materials by referring to these resources; students can benefit from learning software, study abundant materials provided by teachers, and grasp the knowledge in e-learning environments; further, teachers and students can also have fast interactions after classes through forum discussions, online quiz, or Q/A via emails. Although this educational style has brought about lots of conveniences to both teaching and learning, the quality of such an educational process is however nontrivial to model, quantify, and control. Traditional paper examinations may test but not fully reveal the weak points of the teaching/learning, and these results are usually too late for teachers to remedy their teaching plans, specifically for students.

As a means of scaling its efforts in promoting entrepreneurship, FATE Foundation launched the FATE Institute for Venture Design (IVD), which aims to nucleate an innovation ecosystem in Nigeria through the creation of technology and engineering-based ventures, and a shared culture of innovation.    We envision the innovation ecosystem to accelerate wealth creation and prosperity by creating relationships across disciplinary boundaries. These relationships will enable a greater flow of ideas and information in a culture of trust, risk-taking, accelerated learning and co-creation.   IVD will operate a two-year fellowship program that brings together human, intellectual and financial capital. The program is oriented towards letting the fellows start team-based technology and engineering-based ventures addressing discovered needs.",,Lagos,Nigeria,
2011,STEM-preneur,Southern Oregon Education School District,Jay,Matheson,jay_matheson@soesd.k12.or.us,SOCA STEM-preneur Project (Southern Oregon - China STEM-perneur Project),"Our goal is to implement an online collaborative environment that empowers students to build and integrate STEM+ skills and entrepreneurial attitudes and knowledge while actively working to conceive, create and deliver commercially successful products and services.   We will connect technical and business students at three separate Southern Oregon high schools, including several international exchange students from China, using online collaboration tools built on a foundation of HP technology.  This project will help demonstrate the global power of HP solutions in melding entrepreneurial spirit and the application of technical skills.    When it comes to a future that is increasingly digital and global, the question facing areas like Southern Oregon is, ?¢Ê©´What will inspire the next generation to choose an entrepreneurial way of life that will provide hope for solving ongoing community problems?'' The question for educators is, ?¢Ê©´How can students be motivated and inspired to use STEM+ related learning to build a strong base for that choice??¢Êù Or as Zhao Yong, now the Presidential Chair at the University of Oregon, said recently students must understand that  future is the hands of those who know how ''to invent a job, not find a job.?¢Êù",,Medford,United States,
2011,STEM-preneur,University of South Florida Polytechnic,JoAnne,Larsen,jwlarsen@poly.usf.edu,Cap This: STEM+Business Capstone Course,"It is increasingly difficult for STEM problems to be addressed by experts in any single discipline. While multi-disciplinary teams  of experts are required, graduates whose entire education aimed at acquiring a narrow expertise face a tremendous challenge when collaborating with others in such teams.   The University of South Florida Polytechnic (USFP) is the first public polytechnic university in Florida.  Its College of Technology and Innovation (CTI) is one of a handful worldwide to integrate Engineering, Information Technology, and Innovation Management (Business).  A common college core allows its students to take many courses jointly with the objective of preparing them to operate in such multi-disciplinary teams.   This project aims at developing an industry-based capstone project which design will foster inter-disciplinary communication and collaboration skills which will be further supported by the use of open source collaborative technologies. Our project deliverables will include   -a series of industry-based project reports along with rubrics and other instruments used to evaluate students;  -publicly available reports detailing how the design of the industry projects, along with HP equipment and open source technologies have been leveraged to develop target skills   -a project website for disseminating the above deliverables to the community at large.",,Lakeland,United States,
