In the program, students work in teams to identify real-world issues and how best to solve them through the design of mobile and Facebook applications. Through a STEMx lens, this mini-course will help teachers apply a student-driven, problem-solving learning approach that blends complex and integrated content knowledge with lean start-up and agile software development principles.",http://catalyst-academy.org/course/helping-students-change-their-world-through-app-design/,,2013,blank,New Media Consortium,Samantha,Adams,samanthaadams@email.com,Applications of Social Media for STEMx Teaching,"Today’s web users are prolific creators of content, and they upload photographs, audio, and video to Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and many others by the billions. While the initial emphasis of social media was placed on producing and uploading media to these popular sharing sites, as the notion of social media has evolved, it has ultimately become more about the conversations started and relationships formed surrounding this media. In this mini-course, educators will gain a better understanding of how social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, can be leveraged for teaching and learning. Participants will specifically learn how to integrate social media into STEM curriculum to: (1) engage students in insightful discussions, (2) build thriving STEM-focused online communities, and (3) help students discover new areas for informal STEM learning.",http://catalyst-academy.org/course/weaving-social-media-into-stem-teaching/,,2013,blank,TakingITGlobal,Michael,Furdyk,michaelfurdyk@email.com,Challenge-Based Learning on Climate Change: A Mini-MOOC,"TakingITGlobal (TIG) will create STEMx learning modules and resources for educators to support project-based learning experiences with connections to real global problems. TIG will leverage its existing online professional development expertise with courses in environmental stewardship, student voice, and global citizenship, along with relevant educational projects, such as Tread Lightly, DeforestACTION, and Future Friendly Schools. The resources developed will assist TIG in creating more self-guided professional development experiences, as their current online professional development is dependent on real-time, instructor-led sessions.",http://catalyst-academy.org/course/challenge-based-learning-on-climate-change-a-mini-mooc/,,2013,blank,Longwood Institute,Dr. Mano,Talaiver,manotalaiver@email.com,Computational Thinking in K-12 Classrooms,"Join leaders within this mini-course as they help teachers discover valuable resources and strategies for exploring computational thinking in classrooms.

Through its interactive website, RTW enriches curricular concepts by linking classrooms with global mentors who are studying or exploring around the globe.  In this mini-course, teachers are matched across borders for an interactive journey of their own design. Through peer-to-peer instruction, experiential learning, and using geosocial technology, teachers will learn how to cultivate a global perspective in the classroom to help improve students’ critical thinking skills. Participants will earn a badge in global competence instruction.  Teachers enrolled in the course will connect via existing social media networks and follow the global mentors’ online journalism program — reporting via digital media storytelling (photos, videos,  and text) linked to a shared map interface. Training in cultivating an online identity, communicating effectively through digital media, conducting online research and addressing complex global issues with young students are some of the topics to be covered.",http://catalyst-academy.org/course/connecting-students-to-their-world/,,2013,blank,SUNY Empire State College,Dr. Betty,Hurley-Dasgupta,bettyhurleydasgupta@email.com,Exploring STEM Competencies Through ePortfolios,"Portfolios have been used for years to collect student work, but ePortfolios now provide a rich environment for collection, integration, reflection, publication and assessment.  This mini-course immerses teachers in an ePortfolio environment in order to explore its potential for learning and assessment. Participants will be able to engage with other teachers as they create profiles and pages, as well as reflect on their learning through journalling.

There is no single model that informs teachers how to flip a class, but it is clear that they must carefully prepare their material to be “flip friendly” as a prerequisite to success. In this mini-course you will learn how to use analytics-rich tools such as Classroom Salon to gather student engagement data and create a specific set of guidelines to flip your class. The mini-course will teach you how to think about flipping your course and design strategies to make your existing course material (documents, videos and assessments) flip friendly. At the end of the course, you will have successfully created one or more FLIP modules that can be integrated into your teaching.",http://catalyst-academy.org/course/flipping-your-class-an-analytics-based-approach/,,2013,blank,Learning Games Network,Alex,Chisholm,alexchisholm@email.com,Game Design for Learning,"The Learning Games Network is a highly regarded organization committed to helping teachers use games and game-design for learning. Participants in this mini-course will benefit from the resources of the Design Corps Program and its Game Design Tool Kit — an innovative and free online resource to help teachers integrate game design across the curriculum. The toolkit has been specifically refined for STEMx teachers within this exclusive mini-course, and the content will also build a bridge to a larger set of game-based learning resources and introduce teachers to the Playful Learning knowledge network.
