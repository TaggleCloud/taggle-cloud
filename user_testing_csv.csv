We will use HP-provided technology to support and enhance the two institution???s convergent teaching vision relying on the common leitmotif of Activity Led Learning (ALL). CU-DBE and UW-PNCCER are leading efforts to embed ALL concepts into curriculum for the built environment (BE) disciplines (i.e. Architecture, Engineering and Construction). BE constitutes a core group within STEM+ disciplines because of interdisciplinary and emerging educational trends focused on some of the grand challenges of this century: Urbanization, Globalization and Sustainability (UGS). With the support of this grant, we will seek to explore how global collaboration using cloud computing expands our opportunities for teaching and learning in BE to address UGS problems. Benefits from this project are far-reaching because of the potential to connect with Brain Gain member institutions. In addition, the lead role that CU and UW have within their own countries has the potential to magnify the return through dissemination at other tertiary and secondary institutions.",http://sloanconsortium.org/,,2010,Global Collaboratory,East Carolina University,Peng,Li,jetan2@gmail.com,Hands-on information technology virtual laboratory powered by cloud computing for global collaboration,"The speed of scientific and technological advances, along with resource constraints makes it very difficult for academic institutions to maintain technical currency in instructional labs.  Information and distributed computing technologies (IDCT) make it possible to share computing capacity and deliver remote hands-on learning experiences effectively and efficiently. IDCT also brings unprecedented collaborative opportunities to bridge the digital divide in STEM education not only between well-equipped schools and less-funded schools, but also between developed countries and developing countries.     To that end, we are proposing a project that will integrate virtualization and cloud technologies with HP equipment to provide concrete online learning experiences to students worldwide.  This will, among other things, allow us to    1. demonstrate setting up low-cost, open source, cloud infrastructures such as Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) in local schools or colleges;   2. create custom virtual environments and hands-on information technology lab modules which can be hosted on cloud/grid computing networks; and  3. evaluate different collaborative tools such as VNC, RDP, and FreeNX for educational purposes in cloud computing environments.     The project will leverage existing or new cloud computing networks and build a repository of virtual environments to share among faculty and students in secondary and tertiary educational institutions globally.",,La Jolla,United States of America2010,Global Collaboratory,Stamford Public Schools,Bryan,Olkowski,Bolkowski@ci.stamford.ct.us,The Challenge of Water Quality:  China and United States ???Sister Schools??? Seek Solutions Together,"This project builds upon Stamford???s HP Innovation in Education Grant, a multi-disciplinary project involving students in real-world analysis of groundwater, using current technology to track and analyze data, creating maps and graphs that demonstrate findings.  Students obtain results using national protocols, learning about factors influencing the availability and quality of water, topography; and drainage, flora; & fauna and the impact of urban development. Working with a number of community organizations, they meet scientists and learn about their careers.      Through its Chinese sister school, Shandong University Middle School, Scofield hopes to bring an international focus to the problem of water quality. Shandong also face significant water quality issues -- Shandong Province (Huangshui River Basin) is recognized as one of the most polluted river systems in China.  As in Stamford, much of this problem is a result of a fast growing population, industrial growth and agriculture.  Crucial points are water availability, pollution of water resources, and inadequate sewage treatment.      Through sharing the results of Stamford???s research and city resources with their sister school and teaching them to do their own analysis through videos and web-based contacts, it is hoped that both communities can learn and help to solve these community problems.",www.ilabcentral.org,Evanston,United States of America2010,Global Collaboratory,Cairo University - Faculty of Computers and Information,Mohammad,El-Ramly,m.el-ramly@hotmail.com,Cairo Cloud Computer,"This project aims to develop a cloud computing lab for educational and research purposes at the Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

The GeoTech Center will provide technical expertise and support for the teachers and students at the two partner high schools.  The Genesis Academy will use existing data from the Arizona Department of Health to map, analyze, and study the rates of immunization among youth in the state of Arizona.  By doing so, the participating members of the Immunizers can begin to do draw precise conclusions as to why residents decide whether to get their children immunized.   Critical analysis can be made based on income levels, level of education attainment, proximity to healthcare institutions, and exposure to infectious diseases.  The Innovation Academy for Engineering, Environmental and Marine Science at Moody will incorporate the GIS/HP partnership project into the 9th grade curriculum in World Geography and Advanced Placement Human Geography.  Through the use of equipment, the inquiry based learning projects that involve cross-curriculum applications in Math, Science, English, and technology classes will be benefit from inclusion of data generated from GIS applications.",,,2010,Global Collaboratory,Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology,Isaac,K'Owino,ikowino@gmail.com,Development of an East African computational chemistry infrastructure at Masinde Muliro University of Science and technology,"The proposed project suggests development of a core expertise in computational chemistry in East Aftrica by exploring how to best use collaborative online learning to address two urgent social challenges: (1) mitigation of environmental toxins, and (2) Development of antimalarial natural products. The project further suggests development of a grid service infrastructure for computational chemistry that links to computing resources at partner institutions such as Binghamton University. Through the grid Learners and researchers at MMUST and partner institutions will have access to otherwise expensive computational chemistry resources at Binghamton University including programs such as QCHEM, GAMES GROMACS among others. This will enable investigation of materials that may be too difficult to find or too expensive to purchase. The infrastructure will be linked to the brain gain e-infrastructure project of which the university is a participant. It will be developed over two academic years by teaching developed computational chemistry courses and creating a computational chemistry resource website that will be part of the university e-waste for Brain gain project site found at www.ewaste.co.ke.",,,2011,Global Collaboratory,University of Washington Foundation,Giovanni,Migliaccio,sarsntony@gmail.com,Learning to Create Sustainable Built Environments: Experiential and Contextual Learning (ECL) with Information and Communication Technology for a 21st Century Collaborative Global Education,"STEM+ students undergo coursework where concepts are often divorced from the complexities of real-world situations (i.e. Knowledge De-contextualization). Consequently, students struggle applying fundamental concepts for solving problems. Our efforts to embed experiential and contextual learning (ECL) concepts into curricula for Built Environment (BE) disciplines aim at addressing Knowledge De-contextualization and its consequences.   Emerging BE educational trends are focused on grand challenges of this century, including Urbanization, Globalization and Sustainability. Using ECL to relate concepts to challenges, we seek to explore how cloud computing (1) supports global collaboration; (2) facilitates ECL on UGS challenges; and (3) improves retention and recruitment of marginalized students in STEM+ disciplines.   An HP award will galvanize ECL at the Pacific Northwest Center for Construction Research and Education at University of Washington, whose affiliated faculty have several current and pending grants that will benefit from such award. The Center for Experiential Learning is a leader in ECL research and implementation whereas the Center for Instructional Development and Research is leading assessment of ECL. By leveraging this local UW expertise and connecting to Global Collaboratories, the benefits from this project are far-reaching as we seek to disseminate technology-supported learning methodologies to other secondary and tertiary institutions.",,,2010,Global Collaboratory,Strathmore University,Joseph ,Sevilla,joe@strathmore.edu,Development Active Learner-Centered Online Environment for Collaborative Problem Solving For Computer Science and Information Technology Undergraduate Students in Kenya,"Information and Communication Technologies are increasingly being recognized as essential tools of development???tools that can empower the marginalized, enhance skills, increase productivity, and create new opportunities in learning and research ecosystems. The success of ICT-enabled development will not only be measured by the diffusion of technology, but by advances in development itself: economic growth, education and ultimately, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals especially in developing economies.  STEM+ undergraduate students in many developing economies are disadvantaged because of the negative effects of underdevelopment and the ???digital divide???. Despite recent improvements of the ICT infrastructure and increased investment in ICT by universities, the benefits of shared collaboration, improved learning experience, exchange of ideas and transfer of ???21st century skills??? have not been realized. High teacher/student ratios and poor pedagogy and delivery at this level have exacerbated this situation.  This Research project aims to explore new opportunities that will leverage on the experience of more developed online education environments modeled on active learner centered pedagogy. The project will implement an online eLearning environment that supports problem based collaboration between faculty and students. The eLearning platform and other resources will be accessible through the web and mobile platforms.

This model will utilize people???s tendency to simplify usage of IT, to be socially involved and to collaborate across the globe. We team up with Irkutsk State Technical University to develop and test mobile collaboration platform. The aim of this platform is to create informal education communities to distribute STEM knowledge among students. We will be focusing on field testing and educational module for geosciences to approve practical usefullness of our ideas and technologies.  MoPS users will bring up geological problems (for example field data interpretation) using their mobile devices. Such problems will be distributed among user???s peers (known as friends in social networks), which can redistribute it further for detailed analysis and suggestions. The user who receives the problem can respond or start the discussion among community members. Such collaborative environment will increase learning motivation by setting learning objectives. Active leaders of the community will provide incentives for others. This learning approach is similar to what is happening in modern enterprises and research centers. It will allow students to get practical experience in learning how to learn.",,,2011,Global Collaboratory,Institution of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute  for  System  Programming of RAS,Arutyun,Avetisyan,rweinberg@cmu.edu,"Effective integration of research, development and education based on Mass collaboration technologies","We will establish mass collaboration environment based on existing web laboratory created by ISP RAS.
